In order to generate a databse, we use the command "use <database name>".

For example, we want to generate a database called "FirstDB"
```shell
    use FirstDB
```

**Note** This command also means switch to the FirstDB, however, if the FirstDB doesn't generate before, system will create it and switching your current database to FirstDB.
